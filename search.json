Technically, one analyze pool C2C12 cells microscope visually determine percentage differentiated cells specific condition (temperature, nutrients, …). Practically however, tedious. Luckily, differentiated muscle cells produce protein called myosin (low amounts) produced undifferentiated cells. Using antibody attached fluorescent molecule (.e molecule can emit light certain wavelength excited laser), possible stain myosin analyze pool cells using flow cytometer. flow cytometer device used biological research channels cells small capillary pass front laser one--one. laser light excites fluorescent molecule attached antibody, antibody attached myosin protein present cell. light emitted fluorescent molecule response excitation can captured camera. amount light captured reflects amount myosin present cell, allowing us determine cell differentiated .

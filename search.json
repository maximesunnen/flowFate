Cells threshold EGFP+ cells threshold EGFP-. function permits exclusion untransfected autofluorescent cells analysis. Click ‘GFP gate’ tab display results part curation process (Figure S4C). Next, GFP-expression level bins set . menu bar, click ‘Gate’ select ‘Add GFP bin’ add least GFP-low bin (Figure S5A). specifying desired intensity range bin (Figure S5B). Click ‘Confirm’ (Figure S5A). Note first value displayed GFP-low bin corresponds GFP-threshold value remain unaltered. Optionally, gene-dose dependency intended analyzed, can set two additional bins, GFP-medium -high. Click ‘Add GFP bin’ specify desired intensity range (Figure S5A). demo data, specify three GFP bins: GFP-low = GFP channel intensities 24.1 100 RFU; GFP-medium = GFP channel intensities 101 1000 RFU; GFP-high= GFP channel intensities 1001 10000 RFU. Click ‘Confirm’ set range (Figure S5A). can reset GFP-bin assignment clicking ‘Reset bins’ button (Figure S5B). FlowFate switched ‘Split peaks’ tab, click ‘Split’ (Figure S5C). important step automatically identifies MyHC- MyHC+ subpopulations within defined GFP-bins. clicking ‘Split’, app automatically opens ‘Plot’ panel (Figure S5D). can browse data window. Target samples ‘03_G12C_DMSO’ ‘04_G12C_AMG510’ within demo dataset considered subsequent steps. ‘03_G12C_DMSO’ comprises cells transfected K-RasG12C treated 0.2 % DMSO ‘04_G12C_AMG510’ represents cells transfected K-RasG12C treated 3 mM AMG 510 (Table S1). ‘Split peaks’ panel, individual datasets can selected display MyHC intensity distribution. Multiple selections possible clicking facilitate sample comparisons (Figure S5E). store analysis processing, click ‘Export’ menu bar (Figure S5F). Click ‘Show population statistics’ get table population data necessary statistical analysis outside FlowFate. table contains three columns, (1) sample name (sample), (2) population name (pop), (3) population count (count). ‘Count’ corresponds number events respective population. nomenclature used unambiguously identify different populations explained Table 1. Specify filename click ‘Download’ export data .csv file (Figure S5F). order calculate fraction differentiated cells GFP-low bin, employ data /NonDebris/GFP+/GFP-low/MyHC+ count (MyHC+ cells GFP-low bin) divided /NonDebris/GFP+/GFP-low count, represents total number GFP+ cells GFP-low bin.
